# Global Game Jam 2016 @ [FB HQ](http://globalgamejam.org/2016/jam-sites/facebook-hq-2016)
For GGJ16, the Meta-Ritualists team explored the *ritual* of checking your phone - as a mobile game. Meta, right?

And so we give you: **[Reality Calling](http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/reality-calling)**! To play - simply tap the social media notifications to dismiss them before they clog up your phone, but don't forget to entertain your 'real world' cat as well!
